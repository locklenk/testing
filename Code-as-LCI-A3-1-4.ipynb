    "Python is a **general-purpose programming language**. It is known and used for its simplicity and ability to work across different platforms and systems. It is also accessible for people with little programming experience. There are currently two versions of Python, with Python 2 stopping maintenance in 2020. Python 3 is the preferred version of the language and is under active development. \n",

    "> **Fun Fact**: Python was listed as one of the Top 10 programming languages to know in 2018!\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, **what is a programming language**? Programming languages are a way of giving computers instructions and commands to carry out. These commands are interpreted into a code understood by a machine."
